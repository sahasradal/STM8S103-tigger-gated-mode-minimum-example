# STM8S103-tigger-gated-mode-minimum-example
Minimum assembly example for timer1 gated trigger mode on TI1 (PC6). The timer 1 counter stays in standby on power up. When a low is detected on TI1 (PC6) the timer1 counter starts counting up and stops counting when a high is detected on PC6 (TI1). This is the implementation of RM0016 example for the mode. The timer1 is configured to detect the edge of trigger signal on TI1 (PC6) , count and overflow at 1 second. On applying a low on PC6 the counter starts to count and toggle an LED on PD4 to display counting on each over flow. The LED keeps toggling till the PC6 is low and stops toggling when low is released (goes high s PC6 internal pull up is enabled). STVD project is uploaded. Need to program AFRO0 option byte to enable PC6 as timer1 chanel1 input.
